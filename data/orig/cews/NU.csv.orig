Notes:
1. Province/Territory is determined by the business address of the applicant  and may not fully reflect where the economic activity took place as some businesses will have employees and/or business activity in more than one jurisdiction.
2. Industry sectors are derived using the North American Industrial Classification System codes assigned by Statistics Canada.'Not Assigned' indicates that the applicant does not have a Statistics Canada assigned NAICS code.
3. As employers may submit a separate CEWS claim for each period  the total number of employees for all periods can result in double counting if summing all periods together. As a result  the totals for employee and average per employee are not displayed. The total number of applications does not represent the number of unique employers.
4. All counts are rounded to the nearest ten. Approved CEWS amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand. Average amounts are rounded to the nearest dollar.
5. The sum of the data may not add to the total due to rounding.
6. Number of employees are as reported on Line A and Line AA of the CEWS application. For periods 5 and subsequent  Line A is the number of eligible active employees. Line AA is only applicable from Period 5 onward and is represented by  “-”  (not applicable) for periods 1 through 4.
7. CEWS amounts are as calculated on Line H on the CEWS application.
8. Data were produced on January 11  2021. Data are from Canada Revenue Agency source systems as of January 10  2021 11:59:59PM.
9. A hyphen [-] indicates that the information has been suppressed for confidentiality purposes. Suppressed information also includes valid zeros.
10. Data are subject to change as claims are received  reviewed and adjusted.
11. As CEWS claims can be retroactively submitted for any claim period that is open for application  data for periods 1 to 10 are not yet complete.
