Notes:,,,,,,,,
1. In order to better represent the size of the applicant size is determined by the number of T4 slips issuedfor tax year (TY) 2019 by the payroll number of the CEWS applicant and not the number of employees that benefit from the program. As information for TY2019 is not yet complete TY2018 T4 slips were used to complement TY2019 data. As size is based on information from prior tax years it may not reflect the current size of the applicant.,,,,,,,,
2. 'Not Available' indicates that T4 information for the applicant is not available for either TY2019 or TY2018.,,,,,,,,
3. As employers may submit a separate CEWS claim for each period the total number of employees for all periods can result in double counting if summing all periods together. As a result the totals for employee and average per employee are not displayed. The total number of applications does not represent the number of unique employers.,,,,,,,,
4. All counts are rounded to the nearest ten. Approved CEWS amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand. Average amounts are rounded to the nearest dollar.,,,,,,,,
5. The sum of the data may not add to the total due to rounding.,,,,,,,,
6. Number of employees are as reported on Line A and Line AA of the CEWS application. For periods 5 and subsequent Line A is the number of eligible active employees. Line AA is only applicable from Period 5 onward and is represented by  “-”  (not applicable) for periods 1 through 4.,,,,,,,,
7. CEWS amounts are as calculated on Line H on the CEWS application.,,,,,,,,
8. Data were produced on January 11 2021. Data are from Canada Revenue Agency source systems as of January 10 2021 11:59:59PM.,,,,,,,,
9. A hyphen [-] indicates that the information has been suppressed for confidentiality purposes. Suppressed information also includes valid zeros.,,,,,,,,
10. Data are subject to change as claims are received reviewed and adjusted.,,,,,,,,
11. As CEWS claims can be retroactively submitted for any claim period that is open for application data for periods 1 to 10 are not yet complete.    ,,,,,,,,
