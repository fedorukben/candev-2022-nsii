Notes:
1. Data are from Canada Revenue Agency source systems as of October 17 2021 11:59:59PM.
2. Numbers undergo a statistical review to ensure they represent the population of applicants. Numbers are also subject to change as claims are received/reviewed/adjusted.
3. All counts are rounded to the nearest ten. All amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand.
4. The sum of the data may not add to the total due to rounding.
5. Province/Territory is determined by the business address of the applicant and may not fully reflect where the economic activity took place in Canada.
6. As applicants may submit a separate CERS claim for each period; the total number of properties for all periods can result in double counting if summing all periods together. As a result; the overall total for the number of properties is not displayed.
7. Industry sectors are derived using the North American Industrial Classification System codes assigned by Statistics Canada. 'Not Assigned' indicates that the applicant does not have a Statistics Canada assigned NAICS code.
8. Total Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (Line 320) is the sum of Line 300 (Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy) and Line 310 (Lockdown Support).
9. A hyphen [-] indicates that the information has been suppressed for confidentiality purposes. Suppressed information also includes valid zeros.
