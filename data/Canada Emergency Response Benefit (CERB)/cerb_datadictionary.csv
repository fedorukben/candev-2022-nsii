Common business rules,,,,,
1,For confidentiality reasons, the information in this table is subject to rounding or masking. Specifically, if a raw cell count is between 1 and 9, it is set to 0, except in the table by FSA where raw cell counts between 1 and 19 are set to X.
2,Cell counts that are not supressed are rounded to the nearest 10 and dollar amounts are rounded to the nearest $1000.,,,,
,,,,,
Notes,,,,,
1,As ESDC does not allow an applicant to apply more than once for the benefit, the number of applications received will always equal the number of unique applicants. For CRA, as an applicant has to separately apply for each benefit period, the number of unique applicants will always be less than the number of applications received.,
2,A unique beneficiary is an individual who has received a CERB payment either through CRA and/or Service Canada. An individual is counted only once during the life of the CERB program, regardless of the number of times they have received a payment.,,,
3,The province or territory listed is from the applicant's residence, except for the tables presenting data by FSA in which the province or territory is from the beneficiary's mailing address.,,,
4,The FSA is derived from the most recent mailing address of a beneficiary that exists in CRA/Service Canada systems. If the mailing address does not exist, the most recent residential address on file is used.,,,
